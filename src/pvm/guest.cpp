     * This requires casting away the 'const' qualifier, which is generally unsafe.
     * However, it is safe in this specific context because:
     *
     *     a) We are operating on a newly allocated heap object (`memory`).
     *     b) No other part of the system has a reference to this object yet.
     *     c) This is a one-time initialization; the const contract will be
     *        honored for the rest of the object's lifetime after this function
     *        returns.
     * 
     * This allows us to create an immutable descriptor object on the
     * heap.

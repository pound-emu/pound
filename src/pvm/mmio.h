 * This function is on the critical path ("hot path") of the emulator. It

 * falls within any of the registered MMIO regions.
 *
 * The logic is a two-stage process:
 * 1. An approximate search using std::upper_bound finds the first region that
 *    starts *after* the target @gpa. The actual candidate region must be the
 *    one immediately preceding this result.
 * 2. A precise check verifies if the @gpa is contained within the candidate
 *    region's half-open interval [base, end).
 *
 * If a match is found, the corresponding write handler is invoked. If not, the
 * function signals that the access is not handled by the MMIO system and
 * should be treated as a normal RAM access.

 *
 * Search for GPA = 0x4020:
 *
 * 1. upper_bound() finds the first region starting > 0x4020, which is R3.
 *    The iterator 'it' points to R3 at index 2.

 *          [-- R1 --)     [---- R2 ----)      [--- R3 ---)

 *                                              'it'
 *
 * 2. The candidate for the search is the region before 'it', which is R2.
 *
 *          [-- R1 --)     [---- R2 ----)      [--- R3 ---)

 *
 * 3. Final check: Is 0x4020 >= R2.base (0x4000) AND < R2.end (0x4080)? Yes.

## Overview

Join the [**Hassaku Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/aMmTmKsVC7)!

**Hassaku** is an early-stage emulator for the **Nintendo Switch 2**, targeting **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS** (Intel).

Future Supports: **Android**, **macOS ARM**


Initial focus is on implementing the architectural similarities to the original Nintendo Switch. Later stages of development will address differences in hardware between the two console generations.

## Disclaimer

The goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic
of emulation of modern devices and operating systems. **It is not for enabling
illegal activity**. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of
legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet
(you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...). We are not any way affiliated
with Nintendo or NVidia.


## How to Compile Hassaku

See the [**compilation guide**](/resources/docs/compguide.md) for detailed instructions on how to compile Hassaku.


## Codebase

Hassaku reuses selected components from existing Nintendo Switch 1 emulators, primarily **Yuzu**.

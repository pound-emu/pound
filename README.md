## Overview

**Pound** is an early-stage emulator for the **Nintendo Switch 1 and 2**, targeting **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS** (Intel and Apple Silicon).

Initial focus is on implementing the architectural similarities to the original Nintendo Switch. Later stages of development will address differences in hardware between the two console generations.

All information is obtained via reverse engineering of legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet (you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...).
